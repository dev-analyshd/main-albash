## 🔑 Core System Concepts (Now Fully Documented)

### Three Core Rules
1. **One Asset, One State** — Cannot exist in Web2 AND Web3 simultaneously
2. **Value Parity** — $100 Web2 = $100 Web3 (USDC), always preserved
3. **Verification is Global** — Verify once, access everywhere

### Three Operational Modes
1. **Web2 Mode** — Traditional users, fiat, email login
2. **Web3 Mode** — Crypto users, stablecoins, wallet login
3. **Full Mode** — Institutions with both systems + bridge

### Six Smart Contracts
1. AlbashVerification — Global access authority
2. AlbashAssetNFT — Universal asset minting
3. AlbashMarketplace — Buy/sell with fees
4. AlbashBridge — Web2 ↔ Web3 asset bridging
5. AlbashSwap — NFT-to-NFT value swaps
6. AlbashReputation — On-chain reputation

### Six Months to Production
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Verification system
- Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Web2 marketplace
- Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Web3 integration
- Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): Swaps & reputation
- Phase 5 (Weeks 17-20): Community & full mode
- Phase 6 (Weeks 21-24): Scale & harden
